This is a repository for learning tools. At the moment we are starting with building a deep learning framework, and fully connected neural networks have been implemented.

Fully Connected Networks are defined in `Neural.chpl` and examples of how they are used and trained are available in the `examples` folder. The examples can be run with `make` `[example_name]`
